🔄 Python Conditions and Loops – Notes from Python Programming for Data Science
This section includes structured notes on Conditional Statements and Loops in Python. All content is derived from the Python Programming for Data Science course by Miuul.

✅ Conditional Statements
Conditional statements are used to execute specific blocks of code depending on whether a condition is True or False.

1. if Statement
Used to run code only if a certain condition is met.
Example: If a variable x is greater than 10, do something.

2. if-else Statement
Provides two paths: one for when the condition is true, another for when it's false.
Example: If a user is 18 or older, print "You can vote", else print "You cannot vote".

3. if-elif-else Statement
Used when you have multiple conditions to check one after another.
Example: If a score is above 90 → "A", if above 80 → "B", else → "Fail".

4. Logical Operators
You can combine multiple conditions using:

and: Both conditions must be true

or: At least one condition must be true

not: Negates the condition

🔁 Loops in Python
Loops are used to repeat actions multiple times, especially over a sequence like a list or string.

1. for Loop
Used to iterate over items in a list, tuple, set, dictionary, string, etc.
Example: Looping through a list of numbers and printing each item.

2. while Loop
Repeats as long as a specified condition is true.
Example: Keep asking for input until the correct password is entered.

3. break and continue
break: Exits the loop entirely

continue: Skips the current iteration and moves to the next one

4. Looping with range()
range(start, stop, step) is often used in for loops to generate a sequence of numbers.
Example: range(0, 5) gives 0, 1, 2, 3, 4

5. Nested Loops
You can place one loop inside another.
Used for working with multi-dimensional structures like matrices or nested lists.

📌 Purpose
These notes are created for practice and revision purposes, and reflect my understanding of Python's flow control structures from the course.
